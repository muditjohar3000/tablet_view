            <p>Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn
                Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who 
                likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is
                    super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and 
                    will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.
            </p>
            
            <p> Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it 
                when other dogs steal attention from him and he will 
                lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with 
                another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker
                    with the poodle when it was being loud.</p>

            <h2>Cooky</h2>
            <figure>
                <img id="cooky_smile" width="400"
                src="images/cookysmiley.jpg" 
                alt="">
            </figure>
            
            <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around,
                    go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets
                    and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with 
                    his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my 
                    dad, or cooling off in the garage.
            </p>
        
            <p>He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone
                rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing
                towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper 
                and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill
                and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.
            </p>

            <p>Cooper is an 8-year-old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy!
                    He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He’s pretty friendly,
                    but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p>

                    <p>Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves
                    to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he
                    quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>

            <p>A small white dog, wagging his tail in a window, with a garden in the background.Nickels was 
            adopted from Ohio in 2010. He turned 13 years old in June 2023, which he celebrated with a Taylor 
            Swift themed birthday party. Nickels often travels with his family; he has been to over ten states. 
            He has lived in Illinois and California. Nickels is a very unique dog- he is allergic to meat. His
                favorite word is “present.” His one true joy is receiving and opening gifts with his family.</p>
        
            <p>In 2020, Nickels brought home a new dog: Socks. Socks is potentially the villain in Nickels’ 
            life. He destroys Nickels’ favorite toys and is highly allergic to peanut butter, which means 
            Nickels now rarely gets his favorite treat! However, when you find them sharing a dog bed, you
                wonder if the sibling rivalry is all a facade.</p>
